    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cooked rice (preferably leftover rice from the previous day)</li>

        <li>1.5 to 2 cups of water (room temperature or boiled and cooled)</li>

        <li>A pinch of salt</li>

        <li>crushed garlic cloves (optional, traditional in some regions)</li>

        <li>A few curry leaves or green chili (optional, for flavor)</li>

        <li>Mustard seeds or a dash of mustard oil (optional, regional variation)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the rice as you normally would, let it cool completely.

        <li>Transfer the rice to a bowl or clay pot.</li>

        <li>Add water to fully submerge the rice. The water should be at room temperature or cooled boiled water.</li>

        <li>In hotter climates, 8–10 hours may be enough.</li>

        <li>The next morning, it will have a slightly sour smell – a sign of fermentation.</li>

        <li>To serve, you can:</li>

        <ul>

            <li>Eat it plain with salt.</li>

            <li>Add chopped onions, green chilies, mustard oil, and curd/yogurt.</li>

            <li>Pair it with fried fish, pickle, or sautéed vegetables for a complete meal.</li>

    </ol>
